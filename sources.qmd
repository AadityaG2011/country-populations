The data used to create this project came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjdskaggle/2024-population-projections-by-country). ChatGPT helped in creating the code for the graphs. The tidyverse library was used in this project to make the graphs and more. All the observations besides the 10 with the highest 2024 population for the first graph and 35 for the second graph were removed (using the slice_head function) since there were way too many observations to graph without removing any.

China and Russia will decline in population by a combined total of 110 million people by 2050. The data used to create this project came from Kaggle. The data for countries and populations of those countries were mapped in the form of a bar graph to show how the populations changed over time. China and Russia are expected to decline in population in future years.

# Makes a variable for the data.
original_data <- read_csv("2024Populations.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Takes only the 10 most populated countries in 2024 (slice_head), then reorders it so that the data is descending (mutate 1), then takes the population columns and makes them each a row (pivot_longer and mutate 2).
bar_data <- original_data |>

      pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("pop"), names_to = "year", values_to = "population") |>
        mutate(year = str_replace(year, "pop", ""))

# Makes the actual bar plot (ggplot and geom_bar), changes the x-axis labels to comma format (scale_x_continuous), changes the bar colors (scale_fill_brewer), adds labels like a title, subtitle, etc. (labs), and changes the theme (theme_minimal), made text larger and legend on the bottom (theme).
# Not adding caption in labs() because there will be a separate "Sources" page.
country_pop <- ggplot(bar_data, aes(x = country, y = population, fill = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
      scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
        labs(title = "Country Populations for 10 Most Populated Countries in 2024",
             subtitle = "Only China and Russia have a projected population decrease for 2030 and 2050",
             x = "Country",
             y = "Population",
             fill = "Year") +

            theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 30),

                  legend.text = element_text(size = 20),
                  legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
                  legend.position = "bottom",
                  axis.text = element_text(size = 17),
                  axis.title = element_text(size = 20))

# Saved graph as a png file.

In the bar graph, we can see that the yellow and brown bars (years 2030 and 2050) are only less than the orange bar (year 2024) for the countries China and Russia. The difference is most apparent for China, which will lose around 100 million people by 2050. Russia will also lose about 10 million people by 2050. This could cause economic changes because China and Russia are two major countries.

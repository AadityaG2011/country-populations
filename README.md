This project displays a bar graph that shows the populations over multiple years for the 10 most populated countries in 2024. It also includes a scatter plot that shows the population density and land area of the top 35 populated countries in 2024, with the size of the point corresponding with the population in 2024. Furthermore, this project contains a summary of the project, an analysis of both plots, an "About" page, and a "Sources" page.

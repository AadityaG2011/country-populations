In the scatter plot, we can see that the points form a curve shape. The curve tells us that usually, the higher the land area of a country, the lower the population density. We can see that Bangladesh has the highest population density out of the 35 countries on the plot at around 1,350 people per square kilometer. Russia has the highest land area at 16 million square kilometers!
